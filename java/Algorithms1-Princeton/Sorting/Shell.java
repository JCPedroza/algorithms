/**
* Sorts a sequence of items using shellsort.
*
* Shellsort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are 
* far apart. The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, considering 
* every hth element gives a sorted list. Such a list is said to be h-sorted. Equivalently, it can 
* be thought of as h interleaved lists, each individually sorted. Beginning with large values 
* of h, this rearrangement allows elements to move long distances in the original list, reducing 
* large amounts of disorder quickly, and leaving less work for smaller h-sort steps to do. If 
* the file is then k-sorted for some smaller integer k, then the file remains h-sorted. Following 
* this idea for a decreasing sequence of h values ending in 1 is guaranteed to leave a sorted list 
* in the end.
*
* Shellsort is similar to insertion sort; the idea is to move entries more than one position
* at a time by h-sorting the array. H-sorting is like insertion sort, but instead of going 1 
* back we go h back. Insertion sort is used as model because: big increments = small subarray
* and small increments are used when the array is nearly in order, which is good for the
* insertion sort algorithm. 
*
* We have to do a few extra passes to do the higher sorts, but each elements moves only a 
* little bit on each pass and thatâ€™s how shellsort gains its efficiency. The algorithm 
* eventually reaches 1-sort, which is like insertion sort but on a partially sorted array 
* thanks to the previous h-sorts. 
*
* The sequence used on this algorithm is 3x+1. It's used because it is easy to compute.
* Other sequences can be used. It's not known which sequence is the best. One sequence
* tough to beat in empirical studies is the Sedgewick sequence: 1, 5, 19, 41, 109, 209, 
* 505, 929, 2161, 3905, ...
*
* Shellsort is specially interesting because it is an example of a simple idea leading to 
* substantial performance gains. It's very useful in practice: 1) Fast unless array size
* is huge 2) Tiny, fixed footprint for code (used in embedded systems, because there is
* so little code) 3) Hardware sort prototype.
*  
* Performance:
* The analysis of shellsort is still open. There's a few thinggs we can say:
* Worst-case number of compares with 3x+1 increments is O(n^3/2). In practice it's much less
* than that. The problem is that nobody knows an accurate model for describing the number of 
* compares taken by shellsort.
