/**
* 3-Sum algorithm Binary Searc approach.
* What it does: Read in N integers and counts the number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
* Faster implementation of the 3-sum algorithm that uses binary search instead of brute force.
* 
* Performance: N^2 log N. 
*
* Limitations: 1) We ignore integer overflow. 2) Doesn't handle case when input has duplicates
* (Integer overflow occurs when you try to express a number that is larger than the largest number 
* the integer type can handle.)
