timing for (var i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) vs

a = n + 1
for (var i = 1; i < a; i++)

R: use microbenchmark package for timing functions 

Scala: to IntSetBinaryT add methods from tweet assignment, like filter. Check first for better implementations of the 
methods though.

Scala and all: implement the Boolean and Nat classes you saw in Scala and

javascrimp dataStructures immutable linked lists: need to change implementation to head and tail throwin and
